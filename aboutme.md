In my spare time I love getting active. I enjoy playing volleyball and soccer, whether that be with my department at work or it be organized intramural play. On top of that I consider myself a recreational runner, in 2015 I completed my first half marathon, and since then I have participated in a number of organized races. 

Other than getting active, I have recently taken up photography! Check out some of my shots <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxFShUyVe18eTFlQMUswcnFOalE&usp=sharing">Here</a>.
