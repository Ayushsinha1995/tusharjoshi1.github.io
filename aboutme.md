Hi! I’m Tushar Joshi, *a soon to be* a chemical engineer, and a person who is passionate about new technology and entrepreneurship. With the hunger to learn, get involved and ‘hustle’, I often involve myself with opportunities that differ from my peers. I am inspired by challenging the norm, and utilizing my analytical skills to solve problems.

I am always interested in researching new technologies, and how they can be implemented for the everyday consumer. Click the link above to find out more about projects and initiatives I have been apart of.
