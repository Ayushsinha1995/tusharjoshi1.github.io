<p align="justify">Legacy is Canadaâ€™s biggest student led entrepreneurship conference. From April 2015 to 2016 I was fortunate to be a part of the Growth and Academic team. Through this role I was able build relationships with a large number of students, faculty and entrepreneurial communities.</p>

<p align="justify">Working closely with the Executive Director and the Director of marketing, we were able to bring out over 550 delegates and have over 16 institutions represented. </p>
