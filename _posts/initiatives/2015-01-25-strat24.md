Strat24 is Ottawaâ€™s premier interfaculty case competition attracting the top 40 students from the faculty of Engineering and Telfer School of Management. 

As a member of the Strat24 executive team I was responsible in helping the director with logistics of the event. In addition, I was responsible for reaching out to faculty representatives and industry professionals to attend the networking event.
