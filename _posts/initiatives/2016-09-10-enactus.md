Enactus creates projects aimed to have an impact based off the triple bottom line: social, environmental and financial. Through Enactus I have been able to participate and be a part of programs, social enterprises and events. 

Currently I am a part of the NOVA project, which aims to re-use littered shipping containers in northern communities for livable and comfortable space for people from all walks of life.
