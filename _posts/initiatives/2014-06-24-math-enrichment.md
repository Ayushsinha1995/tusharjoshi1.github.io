title: Math Enrichment 
category: initiative

Math has been my academic forte since I can remember. When I began university I often found myself helping my peers with new material which was not covered in the general high school curriculum. I took it upon myself to begin a math enrichment program at my high school where I would teach higher level material once a week. 

At these enrichment sessions I would go over university math concepts such as implicit differentiation, optimization, and integration. Through my teaching style I was able to have class sizes of about 15 students, who took time to willingly attend these math sessions.
