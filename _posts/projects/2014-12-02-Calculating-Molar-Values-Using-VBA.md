title: Calculating Molar Values Using VBA
category: project
---

<p align="justify">The purpose of this project is to analyze and evaluate the design procedure for solving exit molar values of a hydrogen forming process. The goal report probes into the use of Microsoft Excel Visual Basics (VBA) for solving this problem and the development of a robust and user friendly program that could be applicable to other non-linear problems.</p>

<p align="justify">The solution to determine the exit molar values in a methane reforming process deals with five equations, two of which are non-linear. A system of non-linear equations cannot be solved through direct elimination and substitution. Hence, Newton-Raphson for non-linear systems of equations is chosen as the method for solving this problem.</p>
