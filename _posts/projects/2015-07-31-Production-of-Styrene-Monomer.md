title: Production of Styrene Monomer
category: project
---

<p align="justify">The goal of this project was to simulate the production of styrene via methanol alkylation of toluene. The process designed was to achieve a 99 mol% purity of styrene. This was done using separation units including a three-phase separator, and distillation columns. Through the use of a recycle, the overall yield of the process was improved to 89%.</p>
