title: Air Flow Measurements
category: project
---

This experiment outlines basic engineering principles of fluid flow. Air was blown through a long pipe equipped with a pitot tube and orfice meter. Six separate  cases with different air flows were explored. For the different flow rate cases, the objectives were to calculate local velocities, average velocities, Reynolds numbers, and discharge coefficients.

To do this a ten-point traverse method was used for the collection of pressure differential data via the pitot tube apparatus. Further relationships between U<sub>avg</sub> / U <sub>max</sub> and Reynolds number was compared to the McCabe plot.
