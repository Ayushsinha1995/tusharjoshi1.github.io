title: Design of an Acetone Production Plant 
category: project
---

The goal of this project was to design and optimize a facility to produce a high production volume (HPV) chemical. To begin, research was done by analyzing European- and Asian-based multinationals as well as North American ones. Upon selection of an economically feasible reaction pathway, a process diagram was created outlining how the plant would be created.

Throughout the project attention was also given to control strategies. Further insight was also given into areas such as unit optimization as well as heat integration to optimize the cost of utilities. Through Honeywell's UniSim simulation software, our group was able to simulate our entire process to obtain accurate data for flow streams.

Finally, a full economic analysis was completed on the process. The capital and cost of operation was calculated. Furthermore, case studies were also completed to determine the rate of return and present worth. To conclude the economic analysis sensitivity case studies were also completed by altering the feed prices, product prices, and market conditions.
