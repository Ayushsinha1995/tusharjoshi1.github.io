This project included investigating two gas-phase reaction pathways to create arbitrary desired product D.  Proceeding the pathway selection, a packed bed reactor (PBR) and a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) were designed. The PBR was found to be more economically feasible for the selected reaction pathway. Optimization studies were conducted to find the optimal temperature and pressure. 

Further investigations were done, which concluded the need of a cooling jacket. Optimization studies deducted that a jacketed PBR bundle consisting of 7 tubes with a diameter of 0.16 m would be ideal for this reaction system. Finally, a cost analysis was performed on the final optimized design, which led to a grass roots cost of $27,834.
